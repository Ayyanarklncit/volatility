#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

This page documents the things we want to accomplish in the 2.1 branch, so we can a) keep track of them, and b) people new to the project can find things to work on.

= To Do for 2.1 =

  * ~~Integrate x64 address spaces~~
  * Merge the linux support into the main branch
  * Create/add a unified plugin output format
  * ~~Port more volatility-1.3 plugins~~
    * ~~cmd_history (not committed to SVN yet, but already ported to 1.4 - just an FYI so others don't duplicate the work)~~
    * ~~symlinkscan~~ 
  * ~~Add in some additional plugins~~
    * ~~raw2dmp~~
  * Framework cleanups
    * Better integrate registry hive address spaces
    * ~~Fix issues for the 2.1.x milestone.~~

= To Do for 2.2 = 

We can create a separate wiki for this if desired (so we don't have 2.2. items on the 2.1 wiki) but for simplicity I'll just use this existing wiki. 

 * Anything leftover from 2.1 (linux support and registry hive AS)
 * Faster/better KDBG and DTB scanners 
 * Auto profile selection (see Issue #268)
 * Pool scanner groups (see scudette branch) for scanning for multiple pool tags with one pass
 * Application profiles (for wow64 on windows) for using 32 bit AS on x64 kernels 
 * Bring x64 support to timers, callbacks, idt/gdt, and apihooks malware plugins 
 * Add attc's mac support? 
 * Add MHL's win32k suite (10+ plugins and API for investigating GUI memory released summer 2012) 

== Additional/Side projects ==

  * Develop/enhance pdbparse using the open source Microsoft CCI pdb parser code.
