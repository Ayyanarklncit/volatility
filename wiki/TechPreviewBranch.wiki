Volatility has become a very powerful project, with expanding use cases. Some of these use cases have not been thought of when we first started writing the framework, and now it is time to evolve the framework and make it better, and more powerful.

In order to explore the future of Volatility and Memory Analysis, scudette created the experimental Technology Preview branch.

You can check out this code using subversion:

{{{
svn checkout http://volatility.googlecode.com/svn/branches/scudette/ volatility-technology-preview
}}}
