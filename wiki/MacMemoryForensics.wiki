#summary Instructions on how access and use the Mac OS X support

= Introduction =

These are the instructions for using the Mac support in Volatility. A presentation on the initial set of features can be found [http://www.slideshare.net/AndrewDFIR/mac-memory-analysis-with-volatility here].

= Determine Your Version =

If you're not sure which one to choose, click the Apple icon in the top left corner of your Mac's screen and choose About This Mac. Look at the Version number, as shown below. 

[https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-J38DLJdf1F8/UVnPpKk2UqI/AAAAAAAADHo/eeqPo0eOyKk/s379/AppleVersion.png] 

To verify your architecture, use the following command. If you see "RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64" then choose the AMD 64-bit profile. If you see "RELEASE_I386 i386" then choose the Intel 32-bit profile. 

{{{
$ uname -a | cut -d/ -f2
RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
}}}

Note: Some Macs ship with kernels capable of running in 32-bit or 64-bit mode. Even if you see "RELEASE_I386 i386" it may be possible to boot your system into 64-bit mode. To check, run the file command on your /mach_kernel. As you can see, the machine below can run as i386 (32-bit), x86_64 (64-bit), or ppc. 

{{{
$ file /mach_kernel 
/mach_kernel: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures
/mach_kernel (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
/mach_kernel (for architecture i386):	Mach-O executable i386
/mach_kernel (for architecture ppc):	Mach-O executable ppc
}}}

Assuming you wanted to switch to a different mode, for testing purposes, you can do the following and then reboot. For more information see [https://support.apple.com/kb/HT3773 Apple Support HT3773]. 

{{{
$ sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64
setting kernel architecture to: x86_64
changes to kernel architecture have been saved.
}}}

= Building a Profile = 

If you need to perform memory analysis on a version of Mac OSX that isn't in the list above, you will need to build your own profile. 

== Getting the source ==

The source can be currently downloaded by checking out with SVN:

{{{
$ svn co http://volatility.googlecode.com/svn/trunk volatility-trunk
}}}

== Creating a profile ==

To create a profile, you first need to download the !KernelDebugKit for the kernel you want to analyze. This can be downloaded from the [http://developer.apple.com/hardwaredrivers Apple Developer's website] (click OS X Kernel Debug Kits on the right). This account is free and only requires a valid Email address. 

After the !DebugKit is downloaded, mount the dmg file. This will place the contents at "/Volumes/!KernelDebugKit". 

== Creating the vtypes ==

=== Step 1 ===

The first step is to get the dwarf (debug) info from the kernel. The following shows how this can be done for the 32 bit debug information:

{{{
$ dwarfdump -arch i386 -i /Volumes/KernelDebugKit/mach_kernel.dSYM > 10.7.2.32bit.dwarfdump
}}}

You would use "-arch x86_64" for the 64 bit information.

Note: The output file name can be anything you want.

=== Step 2 ===

The next step is to convert the Mac dwarfdump output to the Linux style output supported by Volatility:

{{{
$ python tools/mac/convert.py 10.7.2.32bit.dwarfdump converted-10.7.2.32bit.dwarfdump
}}}

=== Step 3 ===

Create the vtypes file from the converted file

{{{
$ python tools/mac/convert.py converted-10.7.2.32bit.dwarfdump > 10.7.2.32bit.vtypes
}}}

== Symbol Information ==

{{{
$ dsymutil -s -arch i386 /Volumes/KernelDebugKit/mach_kernel > 10.7.2.32bit.symbol.dsymutil 
}}}

== Creating the profile (zip) ==

{{{
$ zip 10.7.2.32bit.zip 10.7.2.32-bit.symbol.dsymutil 10.7.2.32bit.vtypes 
}}}

The zip file is now what you use as the profile. Copy the profile into the "volatility/plugins/overlays/mac" directory and then run:

{{{
$ python vol.py --info | grep Mac
}}}

and find the name of your profile. This is what you will use to the --profile option.

= Acquiring memory =

Volatility does not provide the ability to acquire memory. We recommend using [http://www.cybermarshal.com/index.php/cyber-marshal-utilities/mac-memory-reader Mac Memory Reader] from ATC-NY for this purpose. It supports 32 and 64 bit captures from native hardware, parallels, and virtual box. It currently does not support VMware fusion guests.
