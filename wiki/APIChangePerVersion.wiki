#summary Developer notes on API changes per release

<wiki:toc max_depth="1" />

= Introduction =

Volatility's infrastructure and internals sometimes need to change to support new features, capabilities, or even to accommodate bug fixes. Thus the APIs that plugin developers use can sometimes change between versions/releases of Volatility. To maintain the most stable working environment for developers, we'll document the changes we feel are most important on this page.  

= Version 2.2 =

These are changes made after 2.1 that will be present in 2.2. 

== Module Dumping/PE Extraction == 

  * The !ProcExeDump.dump_pe, get_code, and get_image functions previously took an outfd parameter which was used to report errors back to the user with outfd.write. This has been deprecated. The functions no longer accept an outfd parameter, as errors are reported through the standard debug facility. For more information see r2161.
