<img width=400 height=280 src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVKqzej_mUI/AAAAAAAAAws/A7rVWnYkPXU/7.png">

==== Setting Environment Variables ====

After Python is installed, you should make sure that the Python extensions are registered. If you have a regular start menu, click on start and then right click on “Computer” and choose properties.  If you have the classic start menu, just right click on “My Computer” and choose properties. 

<img width=400 height=250 src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVK41X4ZnRI/AAAAAAAAAw0/99TMpPkk-hg/0.jpg">


If you have Windows 7 you will see the following screen.  Choose "Advanced System Settings".  You should see the following (some personal details removed):

<img height=400 width=400 src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVK67_F3wOI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/9wDMHsDcT6k/s640/1.jpg">

Make sure you are on the "Advanced" tab and choose "Environmental Variables":

<img width=270 height=400 src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVK41oIOyiI/AAAAAAAAAw8/NRRSBCkAF-E/2.jpg">

On the next screen find the "Path" variable and click "Edit":

<img width=270 height=400 src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVK418SCMeI/AAAAAAAAAxA/4km0Lnk3PTc/3.png">

Click on the text and scroll all the way to the end.  Append the path of our Python installation to the end of the existing Path variable. Where it says “Variable Value” go to the end of the line and add the following:
{{{
;C:\Python26
}}}
The semicolon separates our new Path location from the current values. If the location of your Python installation is different from the above, type the appropriate folder location instead.

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVK42A7uUhI/AAAAAAAAAxE/yA8twb6hkMI/5.jpg">

Now we are ready to test that we have set up everything correctly. Open a command prompt by clicking on the "Start Menu" and clicking on "Run".  For Windows 7, click "Start" and type "cmd" in the search text box and hit "Enter":

<img width=270 height=400 src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLE-Z03hHI/AAAAAAAAAxc/YnkqyU25rUo/8.jpg">

Type "python" into the command prompt.  You should then see the Python header and command prompt >>>  Type "quit()" to exit.  If this works, Python is installed correctly.

<img width=450 height=250 src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLE-jONBVI/AAAAAAAAAxg/N1k72j0BFbE/10.png">

=== Installing Dependencies ===


==== Installing MinGW ====

Occasionally you will need a C/C++ compiler in order to install Python libraries.  If you install Distorm3 or Pycrypto from source, you will need a compiler.  Download the compiler from the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Automated%20MinGW%20Installer/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20101030/ Sourceforge] site.  Make sure you get the "ming-get-inst" installer as shown below:

<img width=550 height=250 src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLT6Y753BI/AAAAAAAAAx4/mR34Go3_kms/1.jpg">

Double click the installer.  You should see the following picture.  Hit Next to continue.

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLT6R76xgI/AAAAAAAAAx8/9o1jGaZplqE/2.png">

If you are running as Administrator you will see the following screen.  Just hit Next.

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLT6n_CESI/AAAAAAAAAyA/mHVU9Ak3X94/3.png">

You will have a choice to install the latest MinGW build or prepackaged binaries.

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLT64VhyhI/AAAAAAAAAyE/ialoUjmYAWY/4.png">

Accept the agreement.

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLT65ovpTI/AAAAAAAAAyI/H0i0f-chxPA/5.png">

Choose a location to install MinGW.  

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLUEt0hGsI/AAAAAAAAAyM/E1RtoCiEOw0/6.png">

Keep accepting defaults until you get to the "Select Components" screen.  Here you will need to make sure you have at least the C++ compiler checked as well as "MSYS Basic System" so you will have the "make" utility.

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLUE9HcoeI/AAAAAAAAAyU/btBayTL2qUI/8.jpg">

Hit Next.  A black command prompt may appear as things are installing; just ignore it.  If all goes well you will see the "Finish" screen.  Just hit "Finish".

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLUFazQSkI/AAAAAAAAAyc/BDKXXAUDXZk/10.png">

Add the "bin" directory of MinGW to your path like you did for Python.  If you accepted the default installation directory the text to add would be:

{{{
;C:\MinGW\bin
}}}

<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLULRCmb8I/AAAAAAAAAyg/rEbyB_zYfw4/11.jpg">

You can test that this works by typing "gcc" plus "Enter" at the command line.  You should see "gcc: no input files" if your path variable is set up correctly:

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLULvAPNuI/AAAAAAAAAyk/GbgI4oZ_HWk/12.png">



==== Installing Pycrypto ====

If you do not have a C compiler like MinGW installed, you can install a precompiled version of Pycrypto from [http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto www.voidspace.org.uk].  If you installed MinGW as above you can install Pycrypto as follows.

To install from source, first go to the [http://gitweb.pycrypto.org/?p=crypto/pycrypto-2.0.x.git;a=summary Pycrypto] repository page.  You can download a snapshot as a gzip file:

<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLe8rfhktI/AAAAAAAAAys/8MZdUoSYRDo/1.jpg">

If you have 7zip installed, right click on the downloaded file and choose open 7zip->Open Archive:

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLe85BHYoI/AAAAAAAAAyw/WfuAdwlC3QE/2.jpg">

Double click the tar file inside and click the "Extract" button.

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLe9F_d4qI/AAAAAAAAAy0/vIoSu9teZRY/3.jpg">

Choose a location to extract the folder to:

<img width=450 height=280 src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLe9f5CgzI/AAAAAAAAAy4/mGCt9jcOfM8/4.png">

Once the folder is extracted, open the command prompt and change directory into that folder.  In this case, the folder was extracted onto the Desktop, so the command issued is:

{{{
cd Desktop\pycrypto-2.0.x
}}}

Once inside you can issue a "dir" command to make sure you have all the files, including "setup.py"

<img width=450 height=250 src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLe9rg6WxI/AAAAAAAAAy8/P6_zwZQTjlo/5.png">

Type the following commands to install (wait until the first one finishes before typing the second one):

{{{
python setup.py build -c mingw32
python setup.py install
}}}

As long as you don't see any errors Pycrypto should be installed correctly.



==== Installing Distorm3 ====

Distorm3 is used by several Malware plugins as well as the Core Volshell plugin.  It's easiest to install the precompiled library for Python 2.6, which is the method shown here.  Go to the Distorm Google Code page and download the distorm3-1.0.win32.zip which contains the library for Python 2.6.  Unzip the file and navigate into the Python26\Lib\site-packages directory:

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLIfzynL2I/AAAAAAAAAxo/7U4hXJvnmaY/1.png">

Copy all contents into your Python 2.6 library location, in this case C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages

<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLIgKMDlAI/AAAAAAAAAxs/uh7Zo-ZIEzc/2.png"> 

You can check the installation by running python and importing distorm3.  If you don't see any errors, distorm3 was installed correctly.

==== Installing Yara-Python 1.4a ====

Download the appropriate [http://code.google.com/p/yara-project/downloads/list yara-python-1.4a.win32-py2.X.exe] Windows installer.  In this guide we will use yara-python-1.4a.win32-py2.6.exe.  Double click the installer and click Next.

<img width=400 height=280  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLjQzWui_I/AAAAAAAAAzE/PyKLXZyKoi0/1.png">

The installer should pick up your Python installation.  If you have more than version of Python installed, choose the installation you will be using for Volatility.

<img  width=400 height=280  src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLjRDXVnrI/AAAAAAAAAzI/cbTUKkhzpU0/2.png">

Accept all defaults, hitting Next until complete.  As long as there are no errors shown installation should be successful.  You an always verify by running Python and typing "import yara"

=== Installing TortoiseSVN ===

In order to get the source code for Volatility 2.0 from the repository, you will need a Subversion (SVN) client.  You can download the client from [http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html].  Make sure to choose the correct installer:

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLoO5rfotI/AAAAAAAAAzs/fS0zwywCsjA/1.jpg">

Double click the installer and keep hitting next.  Accept all defaults and accept the user agreement.  Hit "Finish" when the installation completes.

=== Installing Volatility 2.0 from SVN ===

Once you have a Subversion client installed, you can download the latest source code for Volatility 2.0 from the code repository.  This guide will use TortoiseSVN.  First create a folder where you want to keep the Volatility source code.  For this guide we will create a folder "C:\Volatility 2.0".  Go inside this folder and right-click, bringing up the menu options for TortoiseSVN.  Choose "SVN Checkout":

<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVLqIEwzuoI/AAAAAAAAA0M/zFjmO8OO5s8/12.jpg">


Type the following url for the repository:
{{{
http://volatility.googlecode.com/svn/branches/Volatility-1.4_rc1
}}}

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVMIuwteV3I/AAAAAAAAA0Y/cG43UU5Zep0/13.jpg">

All other defaults should be fine, click OK.  When the repository is finished downloading click OK to close out.

<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVMIvBR76bI/AAAAAAAAA0c/_la0-VkUXIQ/14.png">

You should then see all the Volatility source code in the folder.

<img width=400 height=280 src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_55uSCYxbQ8M/TVMIvRHz-4I/AAAAAAAAA0g/Zo69O0MGm_c/15.png">

To use Volatility, open a command line and navigate to the Volatility source directory.  In this case:

{{{
cd "c:\Volatility 2.0"
}}}

Then type:

{{{
python vol.py -h
}}}



You should see a long list of output that includes all of the plugins that are available.  For more information on how to use Volatility check out BasicUsage and CommandReference.

This covers how to install Volatility 2.0 on Linux

=== Installing SVN and Basic Dependencies ===

Luckily installation is a bit easier for Linux.  You will need to install Subversion and libpcre in addition to the dependencies listed above.  These should be available in your distribution's repository.  For example on Ubuntu (as root):

{{{
# apt-get install subversion pcregrep libpcre++-dev python-dev -y 
}}}

For Fedora/Redhat you can use yum to install the appropriate packages.


=== Linux: Installing Pycrypto ===

You have to install !PyCrypto, since it is a requirement for core code. You can download the latest source from [http://gitweb.pycrypto.org/?p=crypto/pycrypto-2.0.x.git;a=summary the pycrypto website] or you can find it in your Linux distribution repository.  The following commands will install this library from source on Ubuntu (you must be root to install):

{{{
$ wget http://gitweb.pycrypto.org/\?p=crypto/pycrypto-2.0.x.git\;a=snapshot\;h=9e9641d0a9b88f09683b5f26d3b99c4a2e148da5\;sf=tgz -O pycrypto.tgz

# tar -xzvf pycrypto.tgz
# cd pycrypto-2.0.x/
# python setup.py build
# python setup.py build install
}}}

=== Linux: Installing Distorm3 ===

For some of the malware plugins and the volshell plugin, you will need Distorm3.  The following commands will install Distorm3 from source (you must be root to install):

{{{
# wget http://distorm.googlecode.com/files/distorm3.zip
# unzip distorm3.zip
# cd distorm3
