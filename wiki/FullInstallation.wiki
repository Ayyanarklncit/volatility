== Setting Environment Variables ==

After Python is installed, you should make sure that the Python extensions are registered. If you have a regular start menu, click on start and then right click on “Computer” and choose properties.  If you have the classic start menu, just right click on “My Computer” and choose properties.

Click on the text and scroll all the way to the end.  Append the path of our Python installation to the end of the existing Path variable. Where it says “Variable Value” go to the end of the line and add the following:
{{{
;C:\Python26
}}}
The semicolon separates our new Path location from the current values. If the location of your Python installation is different from the above, type the appropriate folder location instead.

Now we are ready to test that we have set up everything correctly. Open a command prompt by clicking on the "Start Menu" and clicking on "Run".  For Windows 7, click "Start" and type "cmd" in the search text box and hit "Enter":

Type "python" into the command prompt.  You should then see the Python header and command prompt >>>  Type "quit()" to exit.  If this works, Python is installed correctly.
