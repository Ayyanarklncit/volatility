#summary Mac Profile Reference

= Introduction =

These are the available pre-built profiles for Mac OSX memory forensics. If you don't see your system in the list, please follow the instructions on the [MacMemoryForensics] page to build your own. 

= Determine Your Version =

If you're not sure which one to choose, click the Apple icon in the top left corner of your Mac's screen and choose About This Mac. Look at the Version number, as shown below.

To verify your architecture, use the following command. If you see "RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64" then choose the AMD 64-bit profile. If you see "RELEASE_I386 i386" then choose the Intel 32-bit profile. 

{{{
$ uname -a | cut -d/ -f2
RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64
}}}

Note: Some Macs ship with kernels capable of running in 32-bit or 64-bit mode. Even if you see "RELEASE_I386 i386" it may be possible to boot your system into 64-bit mode. To check, run the file command on your /mach_kernel. As you can see, the machine below can run as i386 (32-bit), x86_64 (64-bit), or ppc. 

{{{
$ file /mach_kernel 
/mach_kernel: Mach-O universal binary with 3 architectures
/mach_kernel (for architecture x86_64):	Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
/mach_kernel (for architecture i386):	Mach-O executable i386
/mach_kernel (for architecture ppc):	Mach-O executable ppc
}}}

Assuming you wanted to switch to a different mode, for testing purposes, you can do the following and then reboot. 

{{{
$ sudo systemsetup -setkernelbootarchitecture x86_64
setting kernel architecture to: x86_64
changes to kernel architecture have been saved.
}}}

Once you have downloaded the profile, place the entire zip file in your volatility/plugins/overlays/mac folder. _Do not extract the zip_.
