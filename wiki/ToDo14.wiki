= Introduction =

This page documents the things we want to accomplish in the 1.4 branch, so we can a) keep track of them, and b) people new to the project can find things to work on.

= To Do for 1.4 =

  # Auto-generate XPSP2 vtypes to unify variable naming
  # ~~Implement caching in any cachable areas of the framework~~
    * Still requires BlockingCacheNodes and some testing
  # ~~Test suites/unit tests~~
  # Add in profile (OS) dependent default variables (DTB/KPCR, etc)
    * Probably going to be done by:
      * implementing constant vtypes for profile-specific signatures
      * implementing plugins for searching algorithms etc
    * Goals for 1.4 are:
      # DTB finder plugin
      # KPCR finder plugin
      # KDDEBUGGER_DATA64 finder plugin
  # ~~Stabilize the interfaces for ASes/Scanners/Plugins/etc~~
    * These seem to be relatively stable, but this should also be a long term goal
  # Documentation, documentation, documentation!

== Ditched for this release ==

  # Sort out Linux code
    * Convert existing linux code to new object framework
    * Convert existing linux scan to new scan engine
    * Write linux plugins

== Miscellaneous Todo ==

  * Write a raw2dump plugin (possibly dependent on write support)
  * Convert over some malware plugins

== Longterm Tasks ==

Please see TodoFuture for long term tasks.
