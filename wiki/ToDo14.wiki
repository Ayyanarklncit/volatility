#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

This page documents the things we want to accomplish in the 1.4 branch, so we can a) keep track of them, and b) people new to the project can find things to work on.

= To Do for 1.4 =

  # Auto-generate XPSP2 vtypes to unify variable naming
  # Test suites/unit tests
  # Implement caching in any cachable areas of the framework
  # Add in profile (OS) dependent default variables (DTB/KPCR, etc)
  # Stabilize the interfaces for ASes/Scanners/Plugins/etc
  # Documentation, documentation, documentation!

== Ditched for this release ==

  # Sort out Linux code
    * Convert existing linux code to new object framework
    * Convert existing linux scan to new scan engine
    * Write linux plugins

== Miscellaneous Todo ==

  * Write a raw2dump plugin (possibly dependent on write support)
  * Convert over some malware plugins
  * Have a go at overwriting hashes in memory (definitely dependent on write support)
