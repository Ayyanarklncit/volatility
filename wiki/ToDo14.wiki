#summary TODO items for the 1.4 branch
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

This page documents the things we want to accomplish in the 1.4 branch, so we can a) keep track of them, and b) people new to the project can find things to work on.

= To Do for 1.4 =

  # ~~Auto-generate XPSP2 vtypes to unify variable naming~~
  # ~~Implement caching in any cachable areas of the framework~~
    * Still requires ~~BlockingCacheNodes and~~ some testing
  # ~~Test suites/unit tests~~
  # ~~Add in profile (OS) dependent default variables (DTB/KPCR, etc)~~
    * ~~Done by:~~
      * ~~implementing constant/algorithmic vtypes for profile-specific signatures~~
    * ~~Goals for 1.4 are:~~
      # ~~DTB finder plugin~~
      # ~~KPCR finder plugin~~
  # ~~Stabilize the interfaces for ASes/Scanners/Plugins/etc~~
    * ~~These seem to be relatively stable, but this should also be a long term goal~~
  # Clear out any release blocking bugs.
  # Documentation, documentation, documentation!

== Ditched for this release ==

  # Sort out Linux code
    * Convert existing linux code to new object framework
    * Convert existing linux scan to new scan engine
    * Write linux plugins
  # Profile (OS) dependent default variables:
    * KDDEBUGGER_DATA64 finder plugin

== Miscellaneous Todo ==

  * Write a raw2dump plugin (possibly dependent on write support)
  * ~~Convert over some malware plugins~~
  * Convert psscan3, objtypescan, symlinkobjscan (tasks carried over from the deprecated [http://code.google.com/p/volatility/wiki/Plugins Plugins page])

== Longterm Tasks ==

Please see TodoFuture for long term tasks.
