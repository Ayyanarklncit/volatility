= Introduction =

This page documents the things we want to accomplish in the 1.4 branch, so we can a) keep track of them, and b) people new to the project can find things to work on.

= To Do for 1.4 =

  # Examine performance/profiling and possibly develop C modules for some parts
  # Documentation, documentation, documentation!
  # Immutable flag for ASes, to tell framework features that they can cache values
    * Probably AS dependent (firewire isn't cachable), but there should be a global override to disable (and possibly enable) caching despite the AS
  # Add in/stabilize Windows 7/Vista support
  # Add in profile (OS) dependent default variables (DTB/KPCR, etc)
  # Auto-generate XPSP2 vtypes to unify variable naming

== Ditched for this release ==

  # Sort out Linux code
    * Convert existing linux code to new object framework
    * Convert existing linux scan to new scan engine
    * Write linux plugins

== Miscellaneous Todo ==

  * Write a raw2dump plugin (possibly dependent on write support)
  * Convert over some malware plugins
  * Have a go at overwriting hashes in memory (definitely dependent on write support)
