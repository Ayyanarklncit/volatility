= What is the latest version of Volatility? =

1.4

= What's new in 1.4? =

...



= Are Volatility 1.3 plugins compatible with 1.4? =

No.  A lot has changed since Volatility 1.3 making older plugins incompatible with the current code base.  The good news is most public plugins have been ported to 1.4 already.  You can check the [CommandReference] wiki to see if the plugin you are looking for is there.  If not you will need to convert the plugin to work with the current code base.  See [CovertingPluginsFromVol13toVol14] for details on how to do this.

= What operating systems does Volatility support? =

Microsoft Windows:
 * 32bit Windows XP Service Pack 2 and 3
 * 32bit Windows 2003 Server Service Pack 0, 1, 2
 * 32bit Windows Vista Service Pack 0, 1, 2
 * 32bit Windows 2008 Server Service Pack 1, 2 ([http://blogs.msdn.com/b/iainmcdonald/archive/2008/02/15/windows-server-2008-is-called-sp1-adventures-in-doing-things-right.aspx there is no SP0])
 * 32bit Windows 7 Service Pack 0, 1

Linux:
 * Volatility doesn't currently support linux memory images, but will  in the next version (1.5). For more information, see [http://dfsforensics.blogspot.com/2011/03/bringing-linux-support-to-volatility.html Bringing Linux Support To Volatility] and [http://dfsforensics.blogspot.com/2011/03/analyzing-new-honeynet-memory-analysis.html Analyzing the New Honeynet Memory Challenge with Volatility] by Andrew Case. Also, see the winning submissions to [https://www.honeynet.org/challenges/2011_7_compromised_server Honeynet's Forensic Challenge #7], which leveraged Volatility.

= What about reading crash dumps and hibernation files? = 

Volatility should automatically determine whether you've asked it to analyze a crash dump file or a hiberation file, and allow you to run plugins against them just like normal.

If you'd like to save these files as raw dd files, you can use the [http://code.google.com/p/volatility/wiki/CommandReference#imagecopy imagecopy] plugin to convert them to raw memory images. The raw memory images can also be analyzed using the normal Volatility commands.

= Can Volatility acquire physical memory? =

Short answer: No.  
Long Answer: The [http://code.google.com/p/volatility/wiki/CommandReference#imagecopy imagecopy] plugin can be used to copy one address space to a file (allowing acquisition from address spaces such as IEEE 1394), but in general no, to acquire memory, you must use another tool. For a list of possibilities, see: [http://www.forensicswiki.org/wiki/Tools:Memory_Imaging The Forensics Wiki]

= Are there any public memory samples available that I can use for testing? =

Yes, see the list below.
