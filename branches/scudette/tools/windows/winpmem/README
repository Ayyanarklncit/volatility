WinPMEM - a kernel mode driver for gaining access to physical memory.

This code is based on the old win32dd codebase, main changes:

- The crashdump producing code is removed.

- A read device interface is used instead of writing the image from the
  kernel. This allows us to have complex userspace imager (e.g. copy across
  network, hash etc), as well as run analysis on the live system
  (e.g. volatility can be run directly on the device).

- This code builds on 64 bit windows as well as 32 bit windows.
